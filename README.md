# Android-Weight-Calculator
This Android Studio project provides a simple barbell weight calculator that takes the desired weight and the weight of the barbell and calculates the weight required on each side of the barbell.

## Getting Started
To use this project, clone the repository and open the project in Android Studio.

## Usage
1. Enter the desired weight in the `EditText` field.
2. Select the weight of the barbell using the `RadioButton` options.
3. Click on the `Calculate` button to get the weights required on each side of the barbell.

## Technical Details
The app is built using Java and the Android SDK. It uses the onClick event handler to get the weight of the barbell from the selected RadioButton, the desired weight from the EditText field, and then calculates the weight required on each side of the barbell. Finally, it displays the weights required on each side of the barbell using a Toast message.

The app uses a layout file to define the user interface. The user interface includes a TextView to display the title of the app, a TextView to prompt the user to enter the weight of the barbell, RadioButtons to select the weight of the barbell, an EditText field for the user to enter the desired weight, and a Button to calculate the weights required on each side of the barbell.
